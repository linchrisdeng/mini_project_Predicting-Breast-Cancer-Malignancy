# mini_project_Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Malignancy

Today, in the USA, about one in eight women has a risk of suffering from breast cancer over their life time. Hence we need to dig out the relevant variables that can predict malignant tumor.

This data can be found on [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

This dataset contains:

Attribute Information:

- ID number
- Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)
